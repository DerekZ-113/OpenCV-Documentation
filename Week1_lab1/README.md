### Notes about the virtual environment
1. Virtual environments create a separate environment with its own python libraries for each project. Each project will have their own dependencies within the same machine.  
2. Avoid global installation.  
3. All the subfolder within where the virtual environment is installed will be under the same virtual environment.
4. Virtual environments need to be activated every time when in a new terminal session. Using the code in step 2 to activate.
